# WHACK 2018

## To Do

* Set up Twilio app: https://www.twilio.com/docs/studio/tutorials/how-to-build-a-chatbot
* Come up with a list of interventions to try out; allow user to add their own interventions too
* How can we figure out presentation? Can we find an optimal presentation too?
    * Can we auto-generate cute graphics to send to the user?

### Done:
* Research different types of implementations

## Idea

Build a text-based chat-bot that prompts the user to track their mental health daily, and walks them through different prevention-based mental health interventions. Will check which interventions work best over time (HabitLab style).

## Goals

1. Give user data back to the user - wrap it up into something pretty
2. Make it super easy and desirable to use and respond to
3. Allow user flexibility to suggest their own interventions and monitor their own behavior

## Details / Notes

### Chatbox personality
* Friendly but professional
