# WHACK 2018

## To Do

### Research different types of implementations
Implementation Types:
    * Chrome extension - Angie
    * Phone app - Angie
    * Web app - Hala
    * Text-based app - Hala

Questions to answer:
1) How would we implement a project like this?
2) Does this sound feasible given the time we have?

## Idea

Build a chrome extension / maybe attached to a website that helps users track which online behaviors are correlated with poor mental health, and suggests that they take a break / suggests some interventions when user seems to be having a bad day.

## Details / Notes

* Behaviors we want to track:
    * Time spent on different sites
    * Ratio of times
    * Time of day using

* Interventions:
    * Ask whether they are feeling okay?
    * Help them wa

* Woebot but an app!!!
    * A preventative app that users can use
    *

* Try out a bunch of different behaviors and choose the best over time
    * Multi armed bandit?

* Tracks how theyre feeling, etc.
* What sites are people visiting? How do we get that info?
* Figuring out how to offer them recommendations

* We dont need a fancy or correct algorithm yo
    * we could just choose whichever has highest hit rate

* Intervention ideas:

^ let's see which of these is the most feasible.
