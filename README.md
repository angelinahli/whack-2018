WHACK 2018

## Ideas

* Clarifai API seems neat: https://clarifai.com/
    * Classify the proportion of meal that is vegetarian, take a snapshot of what you eat afterwards, let people track their diets more closely just via a snapshot.

* Assault protection app - idk. Maybe your phone rings falsely when you need it?

* App that will find you ways to save money and donate the difference to charities you pick

* App that helps users find their way in the dark

* Something that helps long distance couples date but online - some sort of game that inspires connection?

* A game that inspires real human connection, maybe particularly between strangers.
    * Empathy and connection
    * Be authentic to the persons' true voice

* Something like the pixel / the portrait thing that went wild on reddit, where people collaborate in order to paint something. Maybe, a game where you have to negotiate with someone else in order to paint something. Like something that requires teamwork.

* Something that gets people to pair up with others of differing opinions and talk

* Immigration - A step by step process through immigration law in the U.S. like path 2 citizenship.

* app that helps people organize job hunt

* an extension that automatically hides posts that contain the words 'trigger warning'

*
