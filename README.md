# WHACK 2018

## Idea

Build a text-based chat-bot that prompts the user to track their mental health daily, and walks them through different prevention-based mental health interventions. Will check which interventions work best over time (HabitLab style).

## Goals

1. Give user data back to the user - wrap it up into something pretty
2. Make it super easy and desirable to use and respond to
3. Allow user flexibility to suggest their own interventions and monitor their own behavior
