## Ideas

* Clarifai API seems neat: https://clarifai.com/
    * Classify the proportion of meal that is vegetarian, take a snapshot of what you eat afterwards, let people track their diets more closely just via a snapshot.

* Assault protection app - idk. Maybe your phone rings falsely when you need it?

* App that will find you ways to save money and donate the difference to charities you pick

* App that helps users find their way in the dark

* Something that helps long distance couples date but online - some sort of game that inspires connection?

* A game that inspires real human connection, maybe particularly between strangers.
    * Empathy and connection
    * Be authentic to the persons' true voice

* Something like the pixel / the portrait thing that went wild on reddit, where people collaborate in order to paint something. Maybe, a game where you have to negotiate with someone else in order to paint something. Like something that requires teamwork.

* Something that gets people to pair up with others of differing opinions and talk

* Immigration - A step by step process through immigration law in the U.S. like path 2 citizenship.

* app that helps people organize job hunt

* an extension that automatically hides posts that contain the words 'trigger warning'

* VR / AR bonding experience - wayfair api

* app to help incentivize people to track their charitable donations - make a plan, execute on that plan, etc.

* extension that detects which videos / posts seem to be fake news and hides them on youtube (or displays some sort of warning?)

* something where you can hide little easter eggs for people IRL somehow and they can go find them

* ooo like the thing where you listen to an mp3 improv everywhere

* Something that will help users control their use of websites (social media, etc.) - although the big problem for me with this is that I know how to get around it.
    * Maybe instead, something that pops up on your screen and forces you to plan what you want to do with your day?

* gamified exercise somehow

* Behaviors we want to track:
    * Time spent on different sites
    * Ratio of times
    * Time of day using

* Interventions:
    * Ask whether they are feeling okay?
    * Help them wa

* Woebot but an app!!!
    * A preventative app that users can use

* Try out a bunch of different behaviors and choose the best over time
    * Multi armed bandit?

* Tracks how theyre feeling, etc.
* What sites are people visiting? How do we get that info?
* Figuring out how to offer them recommendations

* We dont need a fancy or correct algorithm yo
    * we could just choose whichever has highest hit rate

* Intervention ideas:

^ let's see which of these is the most feasible.
