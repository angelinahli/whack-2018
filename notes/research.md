Here are some ideas for grounding activities:

-Take deep, calm breaths.
-Notice and list things in your surroundings.
-Expose yourself to strong, pleasant sensations, like a pleasing smell or a favorite blanket.

-Splash water on your face or run your hands under the faucet.
-Do a body scan meditation, or pay close attention to each of your body parts one by one.
-Make tea. Feel the warmth of it in your hands, and the taste as you sip it calmly.
-Listen to music.
-Play a categories game, and name some types of dogs, or clothing items, or gemstones, or countries, or anything else you can think of.
-Write in your journal.
-Take a mindful walk, either inside or outside. Pay close attention to your body and your surroundings.
